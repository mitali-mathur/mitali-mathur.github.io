The year was filled with reading, writing, presenting, attending seminars, and of course - some of the activities that kept me sane!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/UC%20Davis%20-%20Year%202.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""/> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> My UC Davis Econ PhD Year 2 Experience </div> <h1 id="second-year-reflections">Second Year Reflections</h1> <h2 id="academics">Academics</h2> <p>To me, second year was all about building collegial relationships with Faculty, reading seminal papers/learning core theories defining my fields, and developing my research ideas.</p> <p>At UC Davis, second year consists of taking 9 field courses - 3 in one major field, 3 in another major field, two elective courses, and one economic history course. My two fields were labor and development, and I took electives in immigration history, machine learning, and a public economics course on optimal policy. Many of the courses in labor/public economics also cross-counted, exposing me to many topics at the intersection of the two fields.</p> <p>For me personally, I found that second year highlighted some of my strengths and encouraged me to continue developing skills in information processing, critical thinking, writing, and presenting.</p> <ul> <li> <b>Information processing</b> - There are SO many papers to read. Before every class, before every discussion, for assignments, and just for fun because it’s interesting. I learned the hard way that it is impossible for me to properly read each paper. Even if I tried, I wouldn’t fully understand all parts of each paper! Then, there was the challenge of reading papers for all classes. Prioritization was key. A few habits that helped: </li> <ul> <li> I would read all the intros/conclusions of required reading. If I was presenting on a paper, I would read the whole paper in more detail and annotate it</li> <li> For each paper I read, I tried to summarize the research question, method, conclusion, and my thoughts in one paragraph of bullets in Google Docs. It’s now a nice reference! For some classes, we were actually required to do this and especially emphasize our thoughts on where the paper fell short/if it inspired other research questions.</li> <li> I downloaded all papers to Zotero so that I could highlight them, annotate them, and easily cite them later </li> <li> For papers I had trouble with, I used AI tools like “Notebook LM” and the “AskPDF” extension to Zotero to answer the clarifying questions I had/confirm my understanding</li> </ul> <li> <b>Critical Thinking</b> - As a former debater, I absolutely loved the classes in which Professors asked us to “poke holes” in the papers we read. This required a sense of how the paper connected to the topics we were learning in class and a strong foundation in econometrics and applied methods (since I took applied micro courses). A few habits that helped:</li> <ul> <li> I tried to avoid the “common” critiques of measurement error and external validity and think of weaknesses more specific to the paper</li> <li> I sucked up my pride and asked econometric questions to ensure I fully understood identification. I asked myself a few key questions: (1) what format is the data in, (2) how would I run this regression, (3) what are the main identifying assumptions needed, (4) how are these assumptions tested, (5) were there other assumptions they needed. If I couldn’t answer these questions, I’d try to ask instead of shying away.</li> </ul> <li> <b>Writing and Presenting</b> - I am a firm believer that communicating economic ideas is a skill everyone needs. No matter how good and technical a paper is, it does not matter if others cannot understand it. I really appreciate that most classes required us to submit referee reports, research proposals, and paper presentations. A few habits that helped:</li> <ul> <li> I utilized office hours and spoke to my peers to discuss my research ideas. Doing so repetitively helped me feel more confident in how to frame my “pitch” and get inspired by questions to refine my proposal.</li> <li> I attended as many seminars I could to be inspired by multiple presentation styles and develop my own.</li> </ul> </ul> <h2 id="work-life-balance">Work-Life Balance</h2> <p>I found second year to be BUSIER than first year, which I didn’t think was possible! It’s a different kind of busy because there is less pressure from graduate requirements (no prelims), but more internal pressure because I was more passionate about the topics. I kept up with the same routines as first year and noted my accomplishments in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ADMG0hM7a19roUm3qhdWuULX9GUy0cs2NIxXLKprJI/edit?gid=522889624#gid=522889624">running list</a> The list now includes more seminars, conferences, and some of my first grants awarded! Everyone’s second year experience is different - but hopefully this provides an <i>example</i> of that types of activities you might expect!</p> <p>I’ll end on a social note. While first year had a TON of camaraderie since everyone in my cohort took the same classes and studied for prelims together, second year was socially a bit different. I am very lucky and thankful that our cohort remained close through birthday celebrations, lunches, and social events. But I was surprised that I saw many classmates less frequently if they were following different field tracks and taking different classes. Since I craved social interaction, I tried my best to make an extra effort and meet with the cohort mates not in my classes.</p> <blockquote> <p>Overall, I am very satisfied with second year and feel anxious, but prepared for the “leap” to research!</p> </blockquote>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflections from a year without prelims]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Flourishing in the First Year</title><link href="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Flourishing in the First Year"/><published>2023-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-blog/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1> <p>I wrote this three-part series to share <i><b>reflections, routines, and resources</b></i> that helped me feel happy, motivated, and disciplined throughout the first year of my econ PhD.</p> <p>Coming into a PhD program without a Masters degree and after working was definitely an adjustment. As many others have shared before me, you never really know what you’re getting yourself into until you’re here. I tried to prepare myself by speaking to friends currently in PhD programs and by reading blogs. I am a huge proponent of public goods and really appreciate the resources that are online about surviving/thriving in the first year.</p> <blockquote> <p>While these were certainly helpful, when I look back on my first year, a resource I wish I had would be a more <i><b>practical guide</b></i>. My intention with this blog series is to provide just that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Many resources emphasize the importance of “studying,” “working in groups” and “learning how to think.” When I got to grad school, everyone said their weekend plans involved “studying” - but I never really knew what people were doing! While my reflections, routines, and resources may seem obvious to me now, I definitely had not developed them or thought about them prior to starting my first year. I thought it might be helpful to document what I wish I knew before I started my PhD.</p> <p>I want to emphasize that I do not think there is “one way” or “right way” to do “well” during the first year, but I want to share <i>“a way.”</i> Everyone has their own preferred ways of learning/balancing life and many of my classmates were extremely successful (or more successful!) in navigating first year in their own ways. Therefore, I hope people treat these tips as an <i><b>example</b></i> of some practical techniques that worked for me. What worked for me may not work for others and what worked for others may not have worked for me.

But these reflections are what I wish I could go back and tell myself prior to starting.</p> <p>My first year was unlike anything I’ve experienced before. The program was more rigorous than the work and schooling I had done before and required a lot of discipline and focus. Despite the intensity, after some adjusting, I was able to learn what worked for me to be academically successful and create a sustainable work-life balance.</p> <h1 id="academic-reflections">Academic Reflections</h1> <p>Going back to school was hard. I did not have a Masters degree, did not do a pre-doc, and had worked for 3 years after undergrad prior to the start of the Econ PhD.</p> <blockquote> <p>The academic twin goals of first year are to build a strong math/econ foundation and to pass preliminary exams.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although first year is a lot of school, it is also important to remember that first year performance is not directly indicative of being a successful researcher. Therefore, while I was motivated to do well academically, I felt extra-motivated to get through first year by dipping my toes into research (attending seminars, talking to upper-year students, talking to professors etc.). It was always helpful to remember why I wanted to be here.</p> <h2 id="pre-math-camp">Pre-Math Camp</h2> <p>I gave myself a month off between my last day at work and the beginning of math camp. I moved in with my parents and spent time with family and friends. I tried to get myself set-up for school: I bought an iPad and set-up Notability (which I highly recommend!!). I read a few books, skimmed some notes I made in undergrad for my math and econ classes, and watched some random youtube videos. So I wouldn’t say I “studied hard” before math camp - rather, I familiarized myself with some core concepts so that I wasn’t lost with the basics. I am actually glad I did and wish I knew how I could have focused my review better.</p> <p>In hindsight, I think the most important concepts to refresh before math camp are:</p> <ul> <li> Matrix algebra and the definiteness of matrices </li> <li> Proof methods </li> <li> Constrained optimization </li> <li> Convexity and concavity </li> </ul> <h2 id="math-camp">Math Camp</h2> <p>Despite math camp being challenging, I am really happy we had it. Firstly, it was a good way to <i><b>get to know my peers</b></i>. We all ate lunch together in the shade outside. I brought a frisbee and threw it around with some folks. I found trying to get to know everyone to be really important - making friends as an adult can be hard!</p> <p>Secondly, I think math camp made me <i><b>internalize the reality that I will definitely be “stuck” on problems</b></i> throughout the PhD. In undergrad, when I was stuck, I would think, take a break, and look at textbook examples, which were similar enough that I could figure out how to solve the problem. That was absolutely not the case for some problems during math camp, and subsequent PhD coursework. There are some problems you can’t just “Google” or “ChatGPT” your way to solving. At math camp, I was forced to start thinking about what to do. I went to office hours and compared problem sets with people in my cohort - two tools that I would later use.</p> <p>Lastly, I enjoyed math camp because it gave me an opportunity to try out different routines to find what would work best for me. I figured out my sleep schedule, how long it took me to commute to class, how I should review what we did after class, what worked for meal prep etc. I also had some time to continue setting up my room, do a Costco haul, and get fully ready for the school year.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/9-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/9-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/9-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/9.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Some members of our cohort on the first day of classes </div> <h2 id="classes">Classes</h2> <p>The first day of each class felt great! I felt like I understood what was going on and concepts were familiar. What a false sense of confidence I gave myself… The slow-start was short lived because we immediately began learning at a very quick pace.</p> <p>A few things were different compared to how I learned in undergrad: applications, problem set breadth, predictability, optional work, and the quarter system:</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Applications:</b></i> There was less of an emphasis in class on solving problems than what I was used to. We had a lot of material to cover and it was completely understandable that professors went through the theory in class and leveraged problem sets and discussion sections to give us opportunities to apply the concepts we learned. For me, this was a bit challenging because I did not directly compare the general notation/definitions to specific applications/examples, so sometimes struggled to understand the purpose of the theory we were learning at the time. </li> <li> <i><b>Problem set breadth:</b></i> There were some elements of problem sets that were extremely challenging. In undergrad, I was used to problems being somewhat adjacent to problems we covered in class. In this program, there were some problems I saw that I had no idea how to even start or attempt since they were so different from the examples in class or textbook problems. This made me realize that understanding <i><b>core concepts</b></i> was more important than solving problems – you can’t just learn how to regurgitate a solution to a problem similar to one you’ve seen before, you need to understand the concepts well enough that if you see something completely new, you have the foundations to solve it. </li> <li> <i><b>Predictability:</b></i> In undergrad, I felt that it was a pretty sure bet that we would be tested on specific concepts. There would be one problem on each topic covered, so while I studied every topic and tried to ace all parts of a test, I knew that if I was a little stuck on one part, I could still do well overall. The models we learned in the PhD were so complex that in a test, we could only be tested on one or two concepts, but expected to know all - which made it difficult to study for tests. </li> <li> <i><b>Optional work:</b></i> In most of our classes, our grades were solely based on a midterm and final, though some classes incorporated problem sets. There were sometimes optional problem sets that were ungraded. I would always attempt the optional work assigned to us, but initially, I would not spend as much time/effort on them or go out of my way to find additional practice beyond what professors recommended. In later quarters, I figured out how to prioritize optional work and tried to be more efficient about getting the most out of it.</li> <li> <i><b>The quarter system:</b></i> The quarter system was such a shock for me. Coming from a school that ran on semesters, I was not used to the lack of breaks within each quarter. For example, there was no time to “catch-up” during Spring break - just a break in between two quarters. </li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>These differences made it difficult for me to be academically successful at the start of my PhD, but over time, I learned how to adjust and felt more engaged and confident as the year progressed.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="studying">Studying</h2> <p>The first test I ever took made me think I would completely fail out. I studied the way I had done in undergrad - I read through notes, re-did some homework problems, skimmed the textbook, and reviewed a few past exams. But when I took the exam, questions had unfamiliar twists that I was not able to understand - I bounced around and tried my best, but felt terrible. When the results were posted, I saw myself at the lower end of a whisker, nowhere near the box with the scores from the majority of the class.</p> <p>I then completely pivoted my approach to studying and figured out that for me, an <b>organized and structured approach</b> to studying was most useful. When I studied in a more organized and intentional way, I saw a massive improvement in my understanding of the course material (which materialized in improved grades and confidence).</p> <p>The main tools I used to study (pretty standard…) were: class notes/lecture notes, problem sets, textbook questions, past exams, papers:</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Class notes &amp; lecture notes/slides:</b></i> I took notes separately from lecture slides to capture the explanations professors gave in class. I then compared my notes to the lecture slides in case I missed anything. </li> <li> <i><b>Problem sets:</b></i> I found it useful to re-do homeworks and problem set problems, whether optional or not. </li> <li> <i><b>Textbook questions:</b></i> For the classes with associated textbooks, I found it helpful to skim/attempt some additional questions. </li> <li> <i><b>Past exams/prelims:</b></i> If a professor had taught the class before, they often shared past exams (or if they didn’t, sometimes students from older cohorts had them on a Google Drive). I always found it useful to solve these past exams and compare my solutions with the answer keys (if available) or solutions from my peers. </li> <li> <i><b>Papers:</b></i> Sometimes it was helpful to read the papers that defined the models for ideas on how the model can be applied or altered in different contexts. </li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/3-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/3-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/3-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/2-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/2-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/2-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/4-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/4-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/4-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photos of UC Davis </div> <blockquote> <p>Everyone has their own way of studying that works! For me, my previous approach to utilizing these study tools was not conducive to mastering such a wide breadth of material. Therefore, organizing my studying became extremely important.</p> </blockquote> <p>The main techniques I used to stay organized while studying were having a thematic study plan, making study guides, forming study groups, attending office hours, and employing “what-if” thinking:</p> <ul> <li><i><b>Thematic study plan:</b></i> I realized that for me, studying by themes was most useful. Before each test, I would go through all the resources I had and organize concepts and practice problems by concept/model/theme. Then, I would study everything I could and do all the practice problems I could in a topical manner (as opposed to a chronological manner). <ul> <li> For example, let's say I am reviewing past exams chronologically. Suppose I study the 2022 final, which asks about model #1 and model #2. When I move to solving the 2021 final, I might get two different models, model #3 and model #4, since not all models are tested each year. But what if I suddenly see that in the 2019 final, there is a different type of question about model #1? I may be unsure how to solve the problem when the context is different or the question is asking something else. </li> <li> In contrast, I could study model #1 first - study my notes, do practice problems, and solve past exam questions on model #1. This will help me fully understand the <i><b>core</b></i> of model #1 and allow me to compare/contrast different applications of the model. In this way, I am not memorizing how to solve specific application problems, but really trying to understand all aspects of the model.</li> <li> <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VIBMYGmYGjYhlQpeq_dArFEDArKR-c6dhV4xO2ya9AA/edit#gid=366404674">Example</a> - this was the mapping I used to organize practice problems by themes, which I used during prelim exam preparation. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <i><b>Study guides:</b></i> After we finished learning each topic, I would work on making a study guide to capture the basic, foundational ideas of what we learned. I mainly focused on including simple definitions, formulas, intuition, and problem-solving approaches. I found the act of making them to be very useful in ensuring I understood the basic foundations of each model and was able to compare and contrast different model features. They also served as “refresher resources” I could use months later while studying for prelims. <ul> <li> These study guides are foundational in that they do not include deep-dives into every single way each model/topic can be applied. They aren’t pretty or typed into Latex. They’re just basic notes to understand basic concepts. </li> <li> All of my study guides can be found in the <a href="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-resources/">resources</a> post! </li> </ul> </li> <li> <i><b>Study groups:</b></i> I utilized studying with my peers when I could and formed a study-group with others who were interested in group studying. Here’s how it worked for us: <ul> <li> About 2 weeks before each exam, I would make a spreadsheet of some past exam questions that would be good practice. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pYwW-Cp8iEbguizOo3REEN4q_uzYDdm04OrZ6_cSobU/edit?usp=sharing">Example</a> </li> <li> We would each “sign-up” to be responsible for certain past exams/questions, solve the exam, and upload our solution to a Google Drive. </li> <li> The benefits were two-fold. (1) As we were studying at our own pace, we could check our solutions against each other’s and ask questions/discuss differences. This was especially helpful when there were not any provided solutions from the professor. (2) We had a dedicated time to chat about things we were confused about or wanted to highlight as tricky/interesting. </li> <li> As the year progressed, we did not meet all too frequently or discuss things for each class, but some folks continued the practice of uploading solutions and we all were available to discuss challenging questions/compare solutions in a more fluid manner in our offices.</li> <li> As much as I wanted structured study groups, the reality is that everyone studies at their own pace and at different times - and that's ok! At the end of the day, everyone should do what works for them! For me, it became important to just have a platform to share work and some peers I could reach out to with questions. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <i><b>Office hours:</b></i> I loved going to office hours. I was intimidated at first that my questions were too silly/basic, but after not doing well on my first test, it sunk in that it’s better to ask and be honest about what I don't understand than to not. I strategically would go to our TA’s office hours when my questions were more minor/specific to a particular problem and to our professor’s office hours when I had broader questions. I also benefited from others being in office hours who had similar questions or asked questions I could ask follow-ups to. </li> <li> <i><b>What-if thinking:</b></i> By utilizing the techniques above, I began to get more excited about the concepts we were learning and tried to implement some “what-if” thinking to see how problems changed in different contexts/under different assumptions. I would ask myself (or a peer), “what if instead of ___, we had ____?” <ul> <li> Solving problems in a thematic way made me more cognizant and interested in ways in which the concepts we learned could be applied. Group studying (when it happened) gave an audience to these questions. Reading papers also helped me discover new applications and appreciate the concepts we were learning better. </li> <li> Asking these what-if questions while studying helped me check that I understood the <i>core concepts</i>. When we are tested or doing our own research, we will be solving something new and contributing to the field. “What-if” thinking helps immediately with solving problems on tests we’ve never seen before and prepares us better for doing research in later years. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/dept-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/dept-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/dept-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/dept.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/rainbow-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/rainbow-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/rainbow-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/rainbow.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photos of the Social Sciences and Humanities building, which houses the Economics department </div> <h2 id="prelims-preparation">Prelims Preparation</h2> <p>A lot of the second year students and other faculty instilled in us confidence that we would pass prelims. But it is easier to retrospectively say that after they had all passed themselves! Prelims are tough and I don’t want to downplay the hardwork and stress that comes with studying for them. If we didn’t pass them, we’d need to retake them, and if we didn’t pass the retakes, we weren’t qualified to continue in the PhD. So the pressure was on.</p> <p>We had about 5 days between our last final exam of the quarter and the month of preliminary exams, so the entire Spring quarter was truly a grind as we were balancing prelims preparation with the quarter’s coursework/exams. I’ve never worked harder in my life - I was dreaming about solving problems in my sleep. It was a cycle of eat, econ, sleep, repeat.</p> <p>I began preparing for prelims over Spring break, around 10 weeks before our first prelim. My strategy encompassed:</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Studying:</b></i> I utilized the same five techniques as described above to study. <ul> <li> Over Spring Break, I drafted a prelims plan (the “Timeline” tab <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VIBMYGmYGjYhlQpeq_dArFEDArKR-c6dhV4xO2ya9AA/edit#gid=422628291">here</a>) in which I divided up, week by week, which <i>topics</i> I wanted to focus on. Then, I would get to it and solve past preliminary exam questions, past midterms/finals, and past problem set questions. Since we still had coursework for the Spring quarter, I studied for the content on Spring exams by doing past prelims on those topics. I wasn’t always able to stick to my plan (which you can see from the empty checkboxes in the plan I shared), but I tried my best and prioritized where I could. </li> <li> I found the thematic plan for each subject to be very useful and it ensured that I was indeed covering my bases and not skipping reviewing any concept. Since the material on the prelims covered the entire year across all three subjects, it was very important to me that I knew exactly what could be covered and how I could practice. See the (“Micro - List”, “Macro - List”, and “Metrics - List” on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VIBMYGmYGjYhlQpeq_dArFEDArKR-c6dhV4xO2ya9AA/edit#gid=366404674">this</a> prelim planning sheet I used as an example). </li> <li> The planning also helped illustrate which models were <i>emphasized</i> more. Any time I tried to guess the topic of an exam, I was always wrong, so I did not expect that preliminary exams would be any more predictable. But it was still useful to see which models did show up more frequently. </li> <li> I'd like to emphasize that this type of planning is just an example of what I did. Other people in my cohort were very successful with prelims as well by creating their own tools like printing out past prelims and organizing them in binders, going through notes and problems chronologically, creating flashcards etc. By Spring, I think most people had a grasp on knowing what worked for them to study and stuck to it when studying for prelims!</li> </ul> </li> <li> <i><b>Mock exams:</b></i> I found it <i>extremely helpful</i> to do “mock exams” to simulate what a prelim would look like. I did 2 mock exams before each prelim. For each mock, I would choose a past prelim exam that I thought was difficult/I had not done before (so it would be the first time solving those problems for me!). Then, I would go to the exact room we would take the exam in at the exact time of our exam, and take the exam in the time limit we would get. I brought a sheet of paper with me to take some random notes on my <i>experience</i> taking each exam. <ul> <li> I took note of the following: <ul> <li> The <i>temperature</i> of the room (this would help inform how I would dress on exam day) </li> <li> Where the <i>clocks</i> were located (and if I should bring my own) </li> <li> How <i>noisy</i> the room was (were people walking by frequently? Was the AC noisy? Would ear plugs be useful?) </li> <li> How my <i>body</i> was reacting (when did I get hungry? Should I bring more snacks than I did for the mock? How far were the bathrooms? Was I drinking enough water?) </li> <li> How to manage my <i>papers</i> (each question was roughly 10 letter-sized pages for me, so I needed to figure out how to manage those pages. I learned through a mock that I should bring paper clips for each question and binder clips for the full exam). </li> <li> How much space the <i>desks</i> had (I learned from a mock that carrying a bunch of pens and pencils was overwhelming! I learned to bring a cup to keep all writing utensils in so I wouldn’t have to worry about them rolling off of my desk or taking up space) </li> <li> <i>Time management</i> (How long did I take on each question? How did I utilize the reading period?) </li> <li> <i>Chair</i> comfort (Could I sit for 5 and a half hours comfortably or should I bring a cushion?) </li> </ul> </li> <li> From a content perspective, the mock exams forced me to solve problems without any references. While practicing outside of mocks, I would always try to solve problems without resources, but I did occasionally look at my notes or the answer keys when stuck so that I could save time studying. Taking exams without references let me practice solving problems realistically and practice adding notes about my intuition if I did not feel very strongly about a result. This in turn gave me the confidence that I could solve challenging problems independently and even if I got stuck, I could write something to show what I knew. </li> <li> The mocks were extremely useful in helping me feel confident and comfortable on exam day. I was prepared with what I needed to bring, how I should manage my pages, how I should spend my time, and how my body would feel. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <blockquote> <p>I can’t describe it, but I observed that as we were all studying for prelims, beautiful moments happened where concepts “clicked.” Some of the content we learned across classes started to intertwine in a way that helped us all understand what we were learning more clearly.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="prelims">Prelims</h2> <p>We had 3 preliminary exams (Macro, Micro, Metrics), which were cumulative and spaced out by one week in between each exam.</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Day before:</b></i> The day before the prelim, I did not do any intense studying. I just reviewed my study guides and the past prelim solutions I had made. I shut off all studying by 7pm, ate a hearty dinner, and then got a good night’s rest. </li> <li> <i><b>Day of:</b></i> I got to the exam early. For some exams, our seats were assigned, and for others, we had free seating. Since I had done mock exams in the rooms, I had a pretty good idea of where I wanted to sit for the exams with free seating. So it was nice to get to the exams early. Our exams were all anonymous and the department provided the paper we were supposed to write on. Getting there early allowed me to set up my desk (and cup of pens!), lay my snacks out under my seat, and put my unique identifier on each page (so I wouldn’t have to worry about it later!). <ul> <li> During the exam itself, I tried to execute everything I learned from the mocks and stayed confident throughout. </li> <li> After the exam, I tried to not talk about it. It was done and there was nothing I could do to change what I wrote. There was no point in worrying or overthinking. </li> <li> The exams were a lot more physically demanding than the mocks (probably because of the pressure and brain power used on the test), so I took the remaining time of the day to rest and recover. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>After going through the stress of studying for hours each day, I felt a great sense of confidence after passing prelims and am now really looking forward to the next year of classes.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/6-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/6-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/6-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/5-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/5-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/5-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Pictures of our cohort </div> <h1 id="social-reflections">Social Reflections</h1> <p>Everyone is different and values socializing in different ways - to each their own! Prior to the start of the PhD program, I led a pretty social lifestyle. I wasn’t going out and partying all the time, but I definitely found a lot of joy in being an activities-oriented person: traveling, hiking, playing board games, going to museums, going to parks/on walks, going over to other people’s homes, going out to eat etc. I knew that I would not be able to stay as socially active since my priorities were to study, learn, and pass prelims, but I wanted to find ways to do activities I enjoyed as well. While the quantity of these social activities did decrease substantially, I was able to find ways to begin building social connections at Davis, and hope to continue to grow these next year. Below are a few things I did to help me build connections with others in the community.</p> <h2 id="department-bonding">Department Bonding</h2> <p>I tried to attend every student-faculty and all-department event I could.</p> <blockquote> <p>I think networking is extremely important and sometimes undervalued in PhD programs. I strove to meet all the professors and students I could to begin laying the foundation for friendships and collaborations in the future!</p> </blockquote> <p>I also just found everyone very interesting, so I was very excited to get to know everyone better (inside and outside of academia).</p> <p>Below are some of the opportunities we had to bond with other students/faculty in the department:</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Department parties:</b></i> The economics department hosted two main department-level events: a welcome party in the Fall and a spring party towards the end of the year. I really enjoyed meeting some professors and students from other years in the program. </li> <li> <i><b>Coffee-Donut-Bagel:</b></i> The Graduate Students Association representatives from the economics department would host bi-quarterly morning events in which we could have breakfast and mingle with students and faculty. Some were for students and faculty, and some were for just students. I enjoyed attending these to meet new upper year students and begin to hear about what some professors were interested in researching and doing for fun! </li> <li> <i><b>ARE-crossover events:</b></i> One of my fields of interest is development economics, so I actually was very excited about these crossover events as I knew I would interact with the ARE department in the future. We had two such events: one was a soccer tournament (the Cournot Cup) and the other was a bowling tournament. </li> <li> <i><b>Department IM sports:</b></i> I did not participate in any intramural sports, but I know that many people enjoyed playing on intramural sports teams with faculty and students across different years. Our Economics department IM Soccer team even won last year! </li> <li> <i><b>Holidays:</b></i> I tried to celebrate holidays with other people across all years. I specifically enjoyed celebrating Diwali and Lunar New Year with friends. Although I traveled during Thanksgiving, Winter break, and Spring break, I still was able to have some meals with other students at the beginning/tail-end of these breaks, and I know that people who stayed in Davis set up chats to meet up with each other. </li> <li> <i><b>Camping trips (UC Davis specific):</b></i> Every year, students in the economics department host a camping trip in Lake Tahoe. This was honestly one of the first ways I came to know some upper year students, who I later spent time with. There were other impromptu trips planned and mass-emails were sent out whenever someone had booked a campsite and had openings for others to join. </li> </ul> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/cny-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/cny-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/cny-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/cny.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/diwali-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/diwali-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/diwali-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/diwali.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Diwali and Lunar New Year celebrations </div> <h2 id="cohort-bonding">Cohort Bonding</h2> <p>I absolutely loved meeting people in our cohort. People were from all over the world - Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, India, Japan, Paraguay, Turkey, South Korea, USA. We set up a WhatsApp group so that everyone could stay connected and organize events.</p> <p>Some notable things we did were:</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Birthdays:</b></i> At the beginning of the year, we set up a Google sheet where everyone could note down their birthdays. We all tried to message the WhatsApp group on people’s birthdays and for those that wanted to celebrate, they’d drop an open-invitation to celebrate at a restaurant. </li> <li> <i><b>Yosemite Trip:</b></i> The majority of our cohort went on a trip to Yosemite National Park. We rented a house that could accommodate everyone and had a blast hanging out in the house and park (people split up doing different activities). </li> <li> <i><b>Studying:</b></i> We were too many people to all study in a large group, but we had an active Google Drive where people posted resources and study tools, which we shared with one another. I really value how collaborative and willing to support one another everyone was. </li> </ul> <h2 id="community-friends">Community Friends</h2> <p>From my experience working, I knew that for me, it was important to make friends outside of the program as well.</p> <p>The outlets that I found easy to tap into were:</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Sports team:</b></i> I joined an Ultimate Frisbee community-pick-up team composed of graduate students from different departments, adults, and some undergrads here and there. I found them through Google! I love playing with them and have been able to meet up with a few people outside the field! </li> <li> <i><b>Roommates:</b></i> I chose to live with non-econ-PhD graduate students so that I could make more friends outside of the department. While everyone is studious and respects/understands the studying we all do, we occasionally interact via watching movies, playing board games, and having dinner together. </li> <li> <i><b>Extracurricular courses:</b></i> I know many people who took pottery classes, photography classes, yoga classes, rock-climbing courses, zumba classes etc. I did not join these classes during my first year and stuck with Ultimate Frisbee, but I am interested in trying some moving forward. </li> </ul> <h1 id="why-i-love-uc-davis">Why I love UC Davis</h1> <p>I am very happy to be studying at UC Davis. Since I am interested in migration economics, I think it is a great fit academically. Since I love the outdoors, I think it is a great fit location-wise. And since I really value team camaraderie, I think it is a great fit emotionally.</p> <p>I was pleasantly surprised by how collaborative the environment was. All of the professors I know are extremely qualified, very knowledgeable, incredibly passionate about their research, and truly thoughtful in their teaching. I constantly felt encouraged and really appreciated the enthusiasm of everyone in the department. Students from other years shared resources and advice with our cohort. And our cohort tried to build on those resources to iterate for the next year. I always felt I could message a peer if I needed help understanding a concept or problem. I always felt that the professors were interested in how we were doing both academically and emotionally. As an added bonus, I LOVE living in California – I am able to ride a bicycle to commute 30 minutes a day and live in a place extremely accessible to nature (40 minutes to Napa, 1.5 hours to Tahoe, 1.5 hours to Yosemite!).</p> <p>Despite all the all-day, every-day studying in first year (which was very stressful!), I am very happy that I was able to find small joys in everyday life.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/first_day-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/first_day-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/first_day-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/first_day.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> My first day of classes, Fall 2022 </div> <h1 id="contents">Contents</h1> <p>Jump to the next parts:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-routines/">Routines:</a> This post shares some examples of routines I found were important to develop and maintain. </li> <li> <a href="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-resources/">Resources:</a> This post includes all the study guides I made and organizational tools for streamlining studying. </li> </ul> <p>Return to the <a href="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-blog/">landing page</a> of this series</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part I of my series about the first year of an econ PhD where I reflect on my academic and social experience]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Flourishing in the First Year - Part II.

It was important for me to build certain habits for my own sanity, health, motivation levels, and happiness.</p> <blockquote> <p>I think the most important routines to grow are for health, relationships, development, exam preparation, and budgeting.</p> </blockquote> <h1 id="health">Health</h1> <p>Doing a PhD can definitely take a <i><b>physical</b></i> toll on your body. I think the majority of people in my cohort (myself included) developed some sort of back pain and strain. I even started clenching my teeth at night, which I had never done before. The intense work coupled with feelings of imposter syndrome and adjusting to a new environment also takes a <b><i>mental toll</i></b>. I personally experienced imposter syndrome and compared myself to other peers and PhD students from other departments.</p> <p>I think that everyone was quite cognizant of the ways in which these physical and mental stresses affected their bodies and everyone was surprisingly diligent in trying to proactively stay healthy. Common ways in which people prioritized health were: going to physical therapy, going to psychological therapy, walking pets, and exercising. I really appreciated that while I could see everyone working extremely hard studying all day, people did take some time each day to go on a walk, go on a run, go to the gym, talk to a therapist, etc. The nice part too is that almost everyone commuted to class by bicycle! I loved this because even if I felt I did not have time to do a specific type of work out I wanted, I still got in 30 minutes of cycling a day. I had heard that Davis was a pretty healthy environment, so I was very happy to see this in practice. Even our faculty were very supportive and active themselves - many professors also commute by bicycle, play sports, or go on hiking trips. Some professors even host “life office hours” to discuss anything about life!</p> <p>Health is something I take very seriously, and being in an environment where the type of lifestyle I lead was not only respected, but encouraged, was very nice. My health routine consisted of waking up at 6am, doing yoga before checking my phone, eating breakfast, riding a bicycle to school, studying/attending classes, eating lunch, studying/attending classes, riding my bicycle back home, eating dinner, and sleeping before 11pm to ensure I got at least 7 hours of sleep each night. I also played ultimate frisbee for two hours, twice a week. I did a lot of meal prep and ate out very rarely, which helped me maintain a healthy diet. I am also normally really bad at drinking water, but I tried really hard to stay hydrated!</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/7-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/7-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/7-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/8-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/8-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/8-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/8.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> My main sources of physical activity </div> <h1 id="relationships">Relationships</h1> <p>I think that building and maintaining relationships are extremely important for inculcating a supportive environment for yourself. No one in our cohort was actually from Davis, but I noticed that everyone did put in effort to maintain connections with loved ones back home. We inevitably also built friendships with one another, either through studying with people in our offices, spending time doing cohort activities, or making plans to meet outside of campus.</p> <p>When I moved to Davis, I immediately added the timezones of people I wanted to maintain touch with on my phone and made an effort to stay in touch. Mostly, this materialized in the form of me randomly cold-calling friends and family while commuting by bike (with only one headphone in, so I could still hear my surroundings!). But I also made some plans to talk to my friends. I was lucky enough that some friends visited me and that I was also able to travel and see some friends and family during breaks. I attended all department social events and tried to organize other events for our cohort as well. Staying connected with all of my family and friends really helped me feel supported during stressful periods and I appreciate all the well-wishes they sent me before exams!</p> <h1 id="development">Development</h1> <p>It is hard to build a specific routine for personal/professional development, but I tried my best to get started by participating in the following activities:</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Seminars:</b></i> At the beginning of the quarter, I paid close attention to the invitations to join specific email lists and marked on my calendar when seminars would be held for specific fields. I set a goal for myself to attend at least one seminar per month in a field I was interested in. There were also options to meet some speakers throughout the day they visited. I initially did not sign up for any as I did not have my own research to speak to them about. But some professors really encouraged me to meet with them to get advice and hear different perspectives on how to navigate entering the research topics I was interested in, which I did and enjoyed! </li> <li> <i><b>Mentorship opportunities:</b></i> At UC Davis, the Graduate Student Association matches first year students with buddies, based on interests. I really appreciated meeting with my mentor and tried to come prepared with questions and honest reflections. </li> <li> <i><b>Networking opportunities:</b></i> I tried to attend all of the department events to get to know professors in a more casual setting. Since the main outlet in which first year students connect with professors is through the first year sequence, I felt that I did not know too many of the professors whose research interests overlapped with mine. I emailed a few professors to meet with them and solicit advice about my summer plans. To my delight, all professors I emailed were more than happy to meet with me and all gave me really encouraging feedback and advice! I know that professors are all extremely busy, so I tried to enter these conversations with some specific questions regarding what advice I was seeking. </li> <li> <i><b>News:</b></i> I love listening to and reading the news. It helps me feel like a more well-rounded global citizen and it inspires many research questions. I ensured to include news in my daily routines. </li> </ul> <p>Finally, I like to document the steps I make towards any personal growth. I used to maintain this habit while working and found it extremely useful in identifying patterns, figuring out what new skills I needed to build, and sharing my progress with my mentors. I also personally like having a record so that I can feel accomplished in what I have done and motivated to do other things. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11ADMG0hM7a19roUm3qhdWuULX9GUy0cs2NIxXLKprJI/edit?usp=sharing">Here</a> is my current list.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/bus-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/bus-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/bus-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/bus.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/view-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/view-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/view-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/view.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Photos of UC Davis </div> <h1 id="exam-preparation">Exam Preparation</h1> <p>I think everyone in our cohort developed their own exam routine based on the study habits that worked for them. As I reflected on in the <a href="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-reflections/">previous post</a>, I began studying for exams 2 weeks before each test. I found it most helpful to begin studying for exams by making a plan/mapping out all the practice problems I wanted to complete, creating study guides to summarize main concepts, and working with a study group. I liked starting to prepare early for exams because building the study guides and skimming through the problems I intended on practicing normally inspired many questions that I could ask my peers, TAs, and professors without feeling like I was learning something last minute, since I knew that it took me longer for concepts to sync in. Some people preferred to study in a more concentrated manner closer to the exam date than spread out like I did, but I think it worked for them!</p> <p>During this 2 week period of studying, I was also extra cognizant of being on my phone. What an easy way to waste time! I made “focus/work mode” my friend.</p> <p>On the day of any exam, I had a very specific (and maybe superstitious) routine. I would wake up, make a bigger breakfast than normal (with eggs!) and go to school at my usual time (7:45am). I would review my study guides and review the problems I had practiced. I would stop studying within an hour of the exam and try to go for a walk before or get some sunlight if the weather was nice. I get really nervous cramming or seeing others study right before, so I tried my best to step out of the office. I think the key is just to find out what works for you and follow it through!</p> <h1 id="budgeting">Budgeting</h1> <p>Being a full time student means not working full time. As such, I found it extremely important to budget. I know this is very old school, but in college, I had built myself an expense tracker and budgeting tool on excel, which I continued to use while working and in the PhD program. I know other people who use apps to track expenses as well. I was very diligent in checking that my fellowship and teaching assistant payments were going through and marking all expenses. I think this was key to ensuring I could budget for all of the trips and activities that I had planned.</p> <h1 id="contents">Contents</h1> <p>Jump to the next parts:</p> <ul> <li> <a href="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-reflections/">Reflections:</a> This post describes some practical tips I have for finding academic success and feeling socially connected. </li> <li> <a href="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-resources/">Resources:</a> This post includes all the study guides I made and organizational tools for streamlining studying. </li> </ul> <p>Return to the <a href="https://mitali-mathur.github.io/blog/2023/first-year-blog/">landing page</a> of this series</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Part II in my series about the first year of an econ PhD where I reflect on habits I built]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Flourishing in the First Year - Part III.

In this post, I share some thoughts about resources available to first year students and links to all of the tools I created.</p> <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2> <p>I think the most important resources I leveraged in my first year were:</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Peers:</b></i> Whenever I faced challenges with any content, the first thing I did was turn to someone in my office or study group for support. </li> <li> <i><b>Upper year students:</b></i> I found it very helpful to speak to second year students for immediate support on general advice regarding how they navigated first year. I also benefited from speaking to some 3rd, 4th, and 5th year students about their research. Going to the internal seminars of students on the job market or students sharing early stage research ideas was also very inspiring in helping me grasp what I want to achieve.</li> <li> <i><b>TAs:</b></i> We were very lucky to have TAs for our first year courses. I would go to their office hours for specific questions about particular problems or concepts I thought were too basic to ask professors. </li> <li> <i><b>Professors:</b></i> Office hours were extremely helpful. I learned a lot from the questions my peers asked and from the ways in which professors reframed content for me. All professors were open and welcoming to meet at social events and in one-on-one meetings.</li> <li> <i><b>Admin team:</b></i> It was very nice that we were onboarded and put in email contact with some administrators. Whenever I had logistical questions, I knew who to contact and always had my questions answered. </li> </ul> <p>In later years, I know that there are a lot more resources available through the graduate center and department to support research.</p> <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2> <p>I am very obsessed with organization and found the following tools very useful:</p> <ul> <li><i><b>iPad + Notability:</b></i> I had spoken to many PhD students and they all recommended I get an iPad. And I highly recommend it if you can. I was a bit skeptical at first because I had always taken paper notes. But I got a “paperlike” screen protector, which made it feel similar to writing on paper. I used Notability to organize my notes. I was able to divide sections based on which quarter it was and create sections by class, just like I would do with binders, so everything was very organized. Others I know used GoodNotes and also liked it. I enjoyed taking notes on my iPad because: <ul> <li> I could export all notes as PDFs to Google Drive directly, which made it easier for me to reference while studying </li> <li> I could download past exams and problems and write directly on those PDFs </li> <li> I could download slides and lecture notes and annotate them directly. This was especially useful if there were example problems or equations that would be too painstaking to copy (ex: complicated game trees) </li> <li> I could copy-and-paste and move things around within and across files easily - this made it easier to remain neat and organized during fast-paced lectures </li> <li> It was lighter to carry around than a bunch of binders </li> <li> It made teaching much easier - I could use the laser pointer tool in section to emphasize certain content and teach in a more “live” way </li> <li> It was more environmentally sustainable (judging by how many pages I wrote from note-taking and studying for exams, I definitely saved some trees!) </li> </ul> </li> <li><i><b>Google Drive:</b></i> I relied heavily on our cohort’s Google Drive. We had been given access to some Google Drive folders created by members of older cohorts. Throughout the year, members of our cohort moved relevant files from previous years to our drive, uploaded PDF versions of useful textbooks, and added material from our current classes (problem sets, problem set solutions, exams, exam solutions). A few folks who made study guides (including myself) uploaded those to the drive as well. For exams we didn’t have solutions for, we sometimes coordinated as a cohort, divided problems, and uploaded our own solutions to divide and conquer. It was very helpful to have all reference material centralized in one drive.</li> <li><i><b>WhatsApp group:</b></i> Someone in our cohort set up a WhatsApp chat for us during the summer before our first quarter. It proved to be extremely useful throughout the year. We did use it to share birthday wishes and coordinate social events, but we mainly used it as a forum for sharing information. We also used the polling feature to vote on times the entire cohort could meet for negotiating full-cohort meetings with faculty. I really appreciated having the group as there were often reminders posted about specific deadlines or links people shared to important information.</li> </ul> <h1 id="specific-resources--examples">Specific resources &amp; examples</h1> <p>In the spirit of publishing public goods, I would like to share some of the study tools I created and described in previous posts.</p> <h2 id="study-guides">Study Guides</h2> <p>As mentioned earlier, these study guides are very basic and foundational. They are not deep-dives into all applications of a concept, because there can be many! Rather, I tried to isolate the base models we learned and compare/contrast topics. I found these guides very helpful to make and helpful to review (especially when wanting to study models for prelims after many months of not thinking about them!). I decided not to type these guides out on Latex because I wanted to provide an example of some raw and realistic study guides created during the school year. I have no idea if they will be helpful, but if they can be, I am happy to share them! The guides are organized as follows:</p> <table class="bootstrap-table bootstrap4"> <tr> <th>Topic</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> <tr> <td>A link to the study guide that will redirect to Google Drive </td> <td>A description of some of the topics covered.

These exams were cumulative and we could be asked anything! That is a lot of material: past prelim exams, past finals, past midterms, and past problems to review.</p> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to ensure that I had a direction with my studying - I did not want to be in a situation in which I would sit down for a prelim and realize I missed studying something. I knew I would have regrets if I did. So I made a big planning sheet.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VIBMYGmYGjYhlQpeq_dArFEDArKR-c6dhV4xO2ya9AA/edit#gid=1827302622">Here</a> is the prelims planning spreadsheet I used (as an example). The tabs are:</p> <ul> <li> <i><b>Topics:</b></i> I categorized concepts and models we learned into broader themes. I organized them by quarter and subject (Macro/Micro/Metrics). </li> <li> <i><b>Micro, Macro, Metrics:</b></i> I organized all of the past problem sets, midterms, finals, and prelims I had access to by topic. I highlighted the past prelims to emphasize them. I included a column in which I could take notes on my experience solving the question, which I later referenced if I wanted to re-attempt a challenging problem of a particular topic/theme/model. These sheets really helped me streamline and prioritize my studying. </li> <li> <i><b>Timeline:</b></i> I created a timeline in which I could divide up which days I wanted to focus on which topics.

I have never lived in the same home for more than 5 years (maybe this PhD will change that?) and love moving around.</p> <p>I was born in Dallas, Texas, and consider that to be my “home base.” But I grew up spending half of my life in Asia - living in Hong Kong and Singapore. I went to college in Washington D.C. and had the opportunity to spend 6 months studying in Scotland and 3 months working in Kenya. After graduating, I moved to India to work in the development sector for 3 years.</p> <blockquote> <p>I am truly thankful for the opportunities I have had moving around, which has sparked my love for travel, adventure, and learning about the world!</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="hobbies--loves">Hobbies &amp; Loves</h2> <h3 id="debate">Debate</h3> <p>In high school, I was very involved in debate. I competed nationally in Lincoln-Douglas debate and had the privilege of representing the United States as a member of <a href="https://www.speechanddebate.org/usa-debate/">USA Debate</a>, where I competed for the World Championship in Thailand (WSDC 2014) and Singapore (WSDC 2015). I truly believe in the transformative power of speech and debate and encourage young people to participate. As an alumni, I love supporting my former teams from afar!
