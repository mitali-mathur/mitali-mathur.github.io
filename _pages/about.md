I am an aspiring economist whose interests lie at the intersection of migration, development, and labor.

Prior to beginning my Ph.D. in economics, I spent time working on research projects in the development sector. I have spent time working in India and Kenya on research projects related to migration, health, data quality, behavioral nudges, and gender equality. 

I enjoy traveling, hiking, playing ultimate frisbee, and scuba diving.
