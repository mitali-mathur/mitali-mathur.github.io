I am an aspiring economist whose interests lie at the intersection of migration, development, and labor.

_Background_
Prior to beginning my Ph.D. in economics, I spent time working on research projects in the development sector. I have worked on research projects related to migration, gender, data quality and behavioral nudges.

_Current_
I currently serve as an organizing committee member of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/the-economics-of-migration/home?authuser=0">Economics of Migration Junior Seminar Series</a> and am a Co-President of the Economics Graduate Student Association at UC Davis.

_About Me_
I enjoy traveling, hiking, playing ultimate frisbee, scuba diving, Odissi dancing, and grilling.
