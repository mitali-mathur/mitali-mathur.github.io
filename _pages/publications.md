description: My research interests lie at the intersection of migration and development economics. I am looking forward to pursuing these topics throughout my PhD. As of now, all of my prior research has been more policy-focused - I contributed to research projects in collaboration with organizations to support their work in generating evidence-based policy recommendations. Below is a sample of some of the projects I played a large role in.
