### Student Evaluations
Below are a few of the remarks from student evaluations. You can view my teaching evaluation record <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1twsv9WJ1OgtepPSdMWtQ8LHk7ApDL7Cx/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>


> "Mitali is the best TA ever. She is awesome. She expertly explains the course content in a way that students can understand, and then apply on their own. Truly a phenomenal TA who works
hard to help student grow."

> "Amazing TA. Her discussion sections were very specific and helpful and sometimes I thought of it more helpful than the actual lectures. Very clear with the work and fielded student questions
extremely well."

> "Excellent TA! Her lecture notes were super super organized, which made studying her lectures easy and effective. Her efforts were appreciated."

> "She was super helpful and would go out of her way to present topics that we had mentioned having difficulties in. 10/10"
