> "Mitali is the best TA ever. She is awesome. She expertly explains the course content in a way that students can understand, and then apply on their own. Truly a phenomenal TA who works
hard to help student grow."

> "Amazing TA. Her discussion sections were very specific and helpful and sometimes I thought of it more helpful than the actual lectures. Very clear with the work and fielded student questions
extremely well."

> "Excellent TA! Her lecture notes were super super organized, which made studying her lectures easy and effective. Her efforts were appreciated."

> "She was super helpful and would go out of her way to present topics that we had mentioned having difficulties in. 10/10"
