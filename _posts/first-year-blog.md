I wrote this page to share reflections, resources, and routines that helped me feel happy, motivated, and disciplined through the first year of my econ PhD. Coming into a PhD program without a masters degree and after working was definitely an adjustment. As many others have shared before me, you never really know what you’re getting yourself into until you’re here. I tried to prepare myself by speaking to friends currently in PhD programs and by reading blogs (I read everything on ___). I am a huge proponent of public goods and really appreciate the resources that are online about surviving the first year. While these were certainly helpful, when I look back on my first year, a resource I wish I had would be a more practical guide. My intention with this page is to provide just that.

Many resources emphasize the importance of “studying,” “working in groups” and “learning how to think.” When I got to grad school, everyone said their weekend plans involved “studying” - but I never really knew what that meant. My first quarter was not great academically and there were some things I did well in and some things I did really poorly in, but I learned along the way and improved over the year. I want to emphasize that I do not think there is “one way” or “right way” to do “well” during the first year, but I want to share tips of “a way.” Everyone has their own preferred ways of learning/balancing life and many of my classmates were extremely successful (or more successful!) in navigating first year in their own ways. Therefore, I hope people treat these reflections as an example of some practical tips that worked for me. What worked for me may not work for others and what worked for others may not have worked for me. And that’s ok. 

Hopefully this page can add some practical context that can help prospective and current first students navigate their own paths! 

## Reflections

My first year was unlike anything I’ve experienced before in some ways, but very familiar in other ways. The program was more rigorous than the work and schooling I had done before and required a lot of discipline and focus. Despite the rigor, I felt that after a bit of adjusting, I was able to learn what worked for me to be successful and create a sustainable work-life balance. 

### Academic Reflections

Going back to school for me was hard. I did not have a master’s degree, did not do a pre-doc, and I had worked between my undergraduate schooling and starting graduate school. So I was nervous going into the program. Even during the application process, I felt overwhelmed that I needed a PhD to get into a PhD program and was amazed by some of the profiles of first year students I saw. Everyone told me to take it easy before the program and relax and I say the same thing to prospective students. But I never really followed that advice and I understand that some people might want to do some things before the program. 

#### Pre-Math Camp

I gave myself a month between my last day at work and the beginning of math camp. I moved in with my parents and spent time with family and friends. I tried to close up some personal projects I was working on. I also tried to get myself set-up for school. I bought an iPad for myself and set-up Notability. I read a few books, skimmed some notes I made in undergrad for my math and econ classes, and watched some random youtube videos. So I wouldn’t say I “studied hard” before math camp at all - rather, I familiarized myself with some core concepts so that I wasn’t lost with the basics. I am actually glad I did and wish I knew how I could have focused my review. 

Upon reflection, based on my experience, I think the three most important concepts to refresh before math camp that I used throughout the first year are:
Matrix algebra and the definiteness of matrices (to start, I found this series to be a good recap of linear algebra) 
Proof methods (I reviewed my proofs and analysis class notes to refresh proof by contradiction, contrapositive, induction etc.)
Constrained optimization ( I wish I reviewed this more prior to the quarter starting)

#### Math Camp

Despite math camp being challenging, I am really happy we had it. Firstly, it was a good way to get to know my peers. We all ate lunch together in the shade outside. I brought a frisbee and threw it around with some folks. I found trying to get to know everyone to be really important - making friends as an adult can be hard! A lot of people in my cohort had roommates or lived with their significant others. I felt very lonely on the first weekend because I realized I didn’t have anything to do with anyone. So I was happy to have an opportunity to begin getting to know everyone prior to the quarter starting. 

Secondly, I think math camp made me internalize the fact that I will definitely be “stuck” on problems throughout the PhD, in a more unfamiliar way. In undergrad, when I was stuck, I would think, take a break, and look at textbook examples or past exam questions, which were similar enough that I could figure out how to solve the problem. That was absolutely not the case for some problems during math camp, and subsequent PhD coursework. There are some problems you can’t just “Google” or “ChatGPT” your way to solving. This definitely amplified my imposter syndrome. But at math camp, I had the opportunity to start thinking about what to do. I went to office hours and compared problem sets with people in my cohort - two tools that I would later use a lot. 

Lastly, I enjoyed math camp because it gave me an opportunity to try out different routines to find what would work best for me. Since classes started everyday at 9:30am, I figured out my sleep schedule, how long it took me to commute to class, how I should review what we did after class, what worked for meal prep etc. I also had some time to continue setting up my room, do a Costco haul, and get fully ready for the school year. 

#### Classes

The first day of each class felt great! I felt like I understood what was going on and concepts were familiar. What a false sense of confidence I gave myself… The slow-start was short lived because we immediately began learning at a very different pace than I had before. 

A few things were different compared to how I learned in undergrad.
Applications: There was less of an emphasis in class on solving problems than what I was used to. We had a lot of material to cover and it was completely understandable that professors went through the theory in class and leveraged problem sets and discussion sections to give us opportunities to apply the concepts we learned. For me, this was a bit challenging to understand because I did not directly compare the general notation/definitions to specific applications/examples, so sometimes struggled to understand the purpose of the theory we were learning at the time. 
Problem set breadth: There were some elements of problem sets that were extremely challenging. In undergrad, I was used to problems being somewhat adjacent to problems we covered in class. In this program, there were some problems I saw that I had no idea how to even start or attempt since they were so different from the examples in class or textbook problems. This made me realize that understanding core concepts was more important than solving problems – you can’t just learn how to regurgitate a solution to a problem similar to one you’ve seen before, you need to understand the concepts well enough that if you see something completely new, you have the foundations to arrive at a unique solution.
Predictability: In undergrad, I felt that it was a pretty sure bet that we would be tested on specific concepts. There would be one problem on each topic/theme/model covered, so while I studied every topic and tried to ace all parts of a test, I knew that if I was a little stuck on one part, I could still do well overall. The models we learned in the PhD were so complex that in a test, we could only be tested on one or two concepts, but expected to know all - which made it difficult to study for tests. 
Optional work: In most of our classes, our grades were solely based on a midterm and final, though some grades incorporated problem sets. There were sometimes optional problem sets that were ungraded. I would always do all optional work, but sometimes would not spend as much time/effort on them or go out of my way to find additional practice beyond what professors recommended.
The quarter system: The quarter system at UC Davis was such a shock for me. Coming from a school that ran on semesters, I was not used to the lack of breaks within each quarter. For example, there was no time to “catch-up” during Spring break - just a break in between two quarters. 

These differences made it difficult for me to be academically successful in the first quarter, but over time, I learned how to adjust and felt more engaged and confident in later quarters.
