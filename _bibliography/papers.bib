  title={Landscaping internal migrant vulnerabilities and labor department schemes},
  description={I am currently leading a research project in collaboration with the research team at Jan Sahas’s Migrants Resilience Collaborative. In this project, I have created a database of different labor department welfare schemes in India. I built a unique vulnerability index using a weighting technique to rank schemes based on vulnerabilities migrants experience. The end product will be an application in which users can enter different demographic profiles of migrants and see a ranking of types of schemes that may be most important to that migrant persona. This research will lay the foundation for understanding gaps in the basket of schemes offered and set-up future research into interventions that can increase internal migrants’ take-up and access to specific schemes.}
