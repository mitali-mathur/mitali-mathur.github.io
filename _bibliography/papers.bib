  title={Landscaping internal migrant vulnerabilities and labor department schemes},
  abstract={I am currently leading a research project in collaboration with the research team at Jan Sahas’s Migrants Resilience Collaborative. In this project, I have created a database of different labor department welfare schemes in India. I built a unique vulnerability index using a weighting technique to rank schemes based on vulnerabilities migrants experience. The end product will be an application in which users can enter different demographic profiles of migrants and see a ranking of types of schemes that may be most important to that migrant persona. This research will lay the foundation for understanding gaps in the basket of schemes offered, derive a methodology that can be used for optimal program design, and set-up future research into interventions that can increase internal migrants’ take-up and access to specific schemes.},

  title={Improving data quality and data use for India’s Aspirational Districts Program},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
