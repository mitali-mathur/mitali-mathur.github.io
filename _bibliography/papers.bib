  title={Landscaping internal migrant vulnerabilities and labor department schemes},
  abstract={I am currently leading a research project in collaboration with the research team at Jan Sahas’s Migrants Resilience Collaborative. In this project, I have created a database of different labor department welfare schemes in India. I built a unique vulnerability index using a weighting technique to rank schemes based on vulnerabilities migrants experience. The end product will be an application in which users can enter different demographic profiles of migrants and see a ranking of types of schemes that may be most important to that migrant persona. This research will lay the foundation for understanding gaps in the basket of schemes offered, derive a methodology that can be used for optimal program design, and set-up future research into interventions that can increase internal migrants’ take-up and access to specific schemes.},

  title={Evaluating the effectiveness of behavioral messages on maternal health},
  abstract={With IDinsight, I worked on the design of an ongoing randomized controlled trial that aims to assess the effectiveness of different types of behavioral messages on knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of pregnant and lactating women in South Africa. The study evaluates different messaging techniques that MomConnect, a maternal mobile health platform, can use to improve maternal health outcomes.},

  title={Evaluating the effectiveness of behavioral nudges at the honest reporting of COVID-19 symptom},
  abstract={I worked on the analysis of a randomized controlled trial that IDinsight and Praekelt designed to understand the role of behavioral nudges in the honest reporting of COVID-19 symptoms by university-goers in South Africa. We found that an appeal for university-goers to be honest was most effective at increasing honesty in mobile HealthCheck daily self-assessment surveys. The results of this RCT highlight the small impacts that low-cost, digital interventions can have.},

  title={Improving data quality and data use for India’s Aspirational Districts Program},
  abstract={As a member of the Data on Demand team at IDinsight, I worked on two different phases of a project with Niti Aayog as part of their Aspirational Districts Program (ADP). In the first phase, I worked on managing data quality for a primary survey of 27,000 households across 27 of the poorest districts in India. In the second phase, I worked on a team to understand the pipeline in which administrative data is collected in each district to identify potential areas of improvement in sampling, training, and data collection processes and implement automated data quality checks.},

  title={Understanding best practices to improve response rates in phone surveys in developing contexts},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
